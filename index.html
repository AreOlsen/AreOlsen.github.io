						Hello! My name is <strong>Simon Brown</strong>. Or well
						that's what I go by on the internet. I am what you would
						call a developer. Mostly I tend to develop websites.
						However I also dabble into games, and other fun
						projects. Unfortunately, most my projects are actually
						privated, and most of the public ones are far from
						finished. The reason being of course the lack of time.
						Oh so annoying time can be, am I right? At the moment I
						am studying at secondary school in
						<strong>Norway</strong>, second year to be precise. But
						do not let that fool you, I have been into programming
						and developing software for quite some time. At the
						moment I am fluent in a couple languages, mainly
						<strong>C#, Python, Html5, Css & JS</strong>. And some
						basic knowledge inside of C++. I am looking forward to
						learning more languages such as C, Rust, and Go. I have
						some knowledge inside the tools of
						<strong>NodeJS/Express</strong>, and in terms of
						game-development: <strong>Unity</strong>. I am a bit of
						a gamer, and I enjoy my free time by being with my
						friends.
