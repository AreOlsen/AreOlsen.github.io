						Hello! My name is <strong>Are Olsen</strong>. Or well that's what I go by on the internet. I
						am what you would call a developer. Mostly I tend to develop websites. However I also dabble
						into games, and other fun projects. Unfortunately, most my projects are actually privated, and
						most of the public ones are far from finished. The reason being of course the lack of time. Oh
						how annoying time can be, am I right? At the moment I am studying at the high school academic level in
						<strong>Norway</strong>, second year to be precise. But do not let that fool you, I have been into
						programming and developing software for quite some time. At the moment I am fluent in a couple
						languages, mainly <strong>C#, Python, Html5, Css & JS</strong>. And some basic knowledge inside
						of C++, and some smaller less used languages. I am looking forward to learning more languages such as C, Rust, and Go.
						I am knowledgeable inside the tools of <strong>Svelte, Tailwind, DaisyUI, NodeJS/Express</strong>, and in terms of game-development:
						<strong>Unity</strong>. I rarely play videogames, more studying and programming for me. I also enjoy my free time by being with my
						friends.
